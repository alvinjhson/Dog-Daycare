      <p>Welcome to Dog Daycare

, we’re more than just a daycare – we’re an adventure-filled experience designed to keep your dog happy, healthy, and engaged while you're away.

Our story began when two lifelong friends, Lily and Max, dreamed of creating a space where dogs could do more than wait for their owners to come home. Lily, a professional dog trainer, and Max, a tech-savvy pet parent, wanted a place where dogs could socialize, play, and explore. Thus, Paws & Play was born – a place where tails are always wagging, and every dog is treated like family!

Our facility features:

Three large playgrounds with exciting obstacle courses
A doggy pool for the water-loving pups
A chill-out zone for those who prefer to snooze in the sun
A relaxing spa room for pampering, complete with grooming services and pawdicures
We pride ourselves on personalizing every dog's experience. Whether your pup loves running through agility courses, splashing in the pool, or simply lounging under our oak tree, there’s something for every personality.

Charlie, our resident golden retriever, even leads the Puppy Swim Club, while Winston, our beloved bulldog, is the king of the relaxation zone!

At Paws & Play, your dog’s well-being is our top priority, and we guarantee a fun-filled day that’ll leave them smiling (and maybe a little sleepy) when they head home.</p>
